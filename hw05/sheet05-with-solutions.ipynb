The performance measure could be the mean squared error between the predicted selling price and the actual selling price. The training experience could involve a dataset of historical housing prices and their features.\n",

On the other hand, not including enough features could result in a model that is too simple and does not capture all the important factors that affect the housing prices. Another tradeoff is the choice of model complexity. A more complex model such as a deep neural network could potentially achieve better performance on the training data but could also lead to overfitting and poor generalization. A simpler model such as linear regression may not achieve the best performance on the training data, but may generalize better to new data."

    "In general, try to write code that's consistent with [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), the offical Python Style Guide. Have a look a the [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) as well. It's based on PEP8 and has some nice examples. As a bonus always document your function and classes with docstrings. It is best practice to stick to some docstring convention for example [Google's](http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html). This has the big advantages that it allows for automated generation of documentation. We will follow that convention in the code we provide you, so you know what kind of objects to expect and what to return.\n",
    "\n",
    "If, during the programming tasks, you run into a `NameError`, make sure that you executed all prior code cells beforehand. Later cells might rely on variables and function from prior cells. To see all currently defined variables you can make use of the `%whos` [magic function](https://github.com/lmmx/devnotes/wiki/IPython-'magic'-function-documentation#whos) anywhere in code cells. Additionally, it is sometimes handy to run all cells from the beginning by opeining the command palette typing `run all cells`. Moreover, using <kbd>b</kbd> to add new cells below and <kbd>a</kbd> for adding new cells above your current cell will make your life often easier. Finally, using <kbd>l</kbd>  to show line numbers is helpful for locating errors from error messages.\n",
