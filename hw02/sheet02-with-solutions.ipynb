However they may also show us a true underlying effect in our data that we didn't expect or account for. This might be the case when we are treating the measurements as a single distribution, when in reality there are actually two underlying distributions. Lastly, our distribution might actually naturally have a high variance, which makes outliers or extreme values a natural part of the distribution.\n",

    "As some parts of this exercise would require some more knowledge of Python than what was already discussed in the practice sessions we built a small number of templates for you to use. However, if you prefer to do so you are also allowed to just go ahead and implement everything yourself!\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the next cell to implement your own solution or, if you want some more guidance, skip the next cell and continue the exercise at  [Step 1) Load the data](#Step-1%29-Load-the-data).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an overview of what you have to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1) Load the data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Load the provided data set. It is stored in `em_normdistdata.txt`. We call the set $X$ and each individual data $x \\in X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2) Initialize EM:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialize three normal distributions whose parameters will be changed iteratively by the EM to converge close to the original distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each normal distribution $j$ has three parameters: $\\mu_j$ (the mean), $\\sigma_j$ (the standard deviation), $\\alpha_j$ (the proportion of the normal distribution in the mixture, that means $\\sum\\limits_j\\alpha_j=1$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialize the three parameters using three random partitions $S_j$ of the data set. Calculate each $\\mu_j$ and $\\sigma_j$ and set $\\alpha_j = \\frac{|S_j|}{|X|}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3) Implement the expectation step:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform a soft classification of the data samples with the three normal distributions. That means: Calculate the likelihood that a data sample $x_i$ belongs to distribution $j$ given parameters $\\mu_j$ and $\\sigma_j$. Or in other words, what is the likelihood of $x_i$ to be drawn from $N_j(\\mu_j, \\sigma_j)$? When you got the likelihood, weight the result by $\\alpha_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a last step normalize the results such that the likelihoods of a data sample $x_i$ sum up to $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4) Implement the maximization step:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the maximization step each $\\mu_j$, $\\sigma_j$ and $\\alpha_j$ is updated. First calculate the new means:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mu_j = \\frac{1}{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{|X|} p_{ij}} \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{|X|} p_{ij}x_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That means $\\mu_j$ is the weighted mean of all samples, where the weight is their likelihood of belonging to distribution $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then calculate the new $\\sigma_j$. Each new $\\sigma_j$ is the standard deviation of the normal distribution with the new $\\mu_j$, so for the calculation you already use the new $\\mu_j$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma_j = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{|X|} p_{ij}} \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{|X|} p_{ij} \\left(x_i - \\mu_j\\right)^2 }$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the new $\\alpha_j$ for each distribution, just take the mean of $p_j$ for each normal distribution $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5) Perform the complete EM and plot your results:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Build a loop around the iterative procedure of expectation and maximization which stops when the changes in all $\\mu_j$ and $\\sigma_j$ are sufficiently small enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plot your results after each step and mark which data points belong to which normal distribution. If you don't get it to work, just plot your final solution of the distributions."

The Gaussian Mixture model can be used for soft clustering since it allows us to express varying degrees of certainty about the membership of individual samples. It is one of the most widely used models since Gaussian distributions generally have the property of fitting all different kinds of data reasonably well.\n",

The probability for individual data $x_i \\in \\textbf{x}$ is calculated correspondingly (note however, that of course the values for individual data differs from the overall probability). \n",

The easiest case is where our mixing distributions are normally distributed, $p_k \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_k,\\sigma_k)$, and our latent class probabilities have a discrete distribution where we only have $\\alpha_k \\in [0,1]$ and the constraint $\\sum_k\\alpha_k=1$.\n",

However, we want to go into the opposite direction and figure out what the distribution of the labels given the data is. This can be calculated easily by Bayes' Theorem for each model $k$, where the (latent) probability for choosing model $k$ is $p(k|\\mathbf{\\theta}_k) = \\alpha_k$:\n",

We have a mathematical framework pinned down, but it contains many variables and it is not *a priori* obvious how we can figure out the best values for them. We *have* some data which we want to use to determine the parameters so the usual approach would be to simply calculate a Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) or an Maximum A Posteriori Estimator (MAP) by maximizing the above formulas over the possible parameters with a method like Gradient Descent. It turns out however that this is very, very hard to do (optimal MLE for a GMM is NP-hard (Aloise et al. 2009; Drineas et al. 2004)) since the $\\alpha_k$ and the $\\theta_k$ are strongly interdependent and neither is known. It *can* still be done with some work-arounds, but there is also an alternative path that we can go down."
