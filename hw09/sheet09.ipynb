You can think of the relation between such instances and their designated classes as individuals of a specific population (e.g. Bernard and Bianca are both individuals of the population mice).

The output vector $o$ of perceptron $j$ of layer $k$ given an input $x$ (the output of the previous layer) in a neural network is given by the following formula. Note: $N$ gives the number of values of a given vector, $w_{j,0}(k)$ specifies the bias of perceptron $j$ in layer $k$ and $w_{j,1...N(x)}(k)$ the other weights of perceptron $j$ in layer $k$.\n",

    "1. ***Forward propagation***: Compute the outputs for each individual layer ‚Äì similar to the forward-propagation step above, but we need to keep track of the intermediate results to compute each layer's errors. That means: Store the input as the first \"output\" and then activate each of the network's layers using the *previous* layer's output and store the layer's activation result.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ***Backward propagation***: Calculate each layer's error signals $\\delta_i(k)$. The important part here is to do so from the last to the first array, because each layer's error depends on the error from its following layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\\delta_i(k) = \\varphi'_i(k) \\sum\\limits_{j=1}^{N(k+1)} w_{ji}(k+1,k)\\delta_j(k+1)$$\n",

    "    Since we use the sigmoid function $\\sigma(t)=\\frac{1}{1+e^{-t}}$ as activation function $\\varphi$ the derivative is $\\varphi'_i(k) = \\sigma'_i(k) = \\sigma_i(k)\\ (1 - \\sigma_i(k))$ and the formula becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\\delta_i(k) = \\sigma_i(k)\\ (1 - \\sigma_i(k))\\ \\sum\\limits_{j=1}^{N(k+1)} w_{ji}(k+1,k)\\delta_j(k+1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    (*Hint*: For the last layer (i.e. the first you calculate the $\\delta$ for) the sum in the formula above is the total network error. For all preceding layers $k$ you need to recalculate `e` using the $\\delta$ and weights of layer $k+1$. We already implemented a helper function for you to access the weights of a specific layer. Check the `PerceptronLayer` if you did not find it yet.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ***Adaptation***: Call each layers adaptation function with its input, its designated error signals and the given learning rate.\n",
